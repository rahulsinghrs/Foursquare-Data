    "### 1. Description of the problem and a discussion of the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company X is an Indian Company that specializes in selling personal care products such as deodorants, talcum, soaps, etc. The company had entered the deodorant market 3 years ago and has consistently had a saturated market share of 2%, in comparison to 2 other companies (Company A, and Company B) which entered the deodorant market at the same time as Company X. Companies A and B have had a consistent market share year on year growth of 1.6% (compared to company X which has had 0.1% year on year growth). The market leader (Company STAR) in the deodorant sector has  40% market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The management of Company X is worried about its stagnant market share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent market surveys undertaken by an independent market analysis firm had revealed that brand awareness and brand perception are the major drivers of sales along with the pricing. Company Xâ€™s further investigations into the results had shown that their price points are comparable to those of the deodorants sold by Company A and B; however brand awareness and product perception (in terms of quality, long lasting effect, etc.) have a crucial role to play in market expansion. Company X has not invested muc in its marketing endeavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company X wants to increase its market penetration and brand awareness in the deodorant industry as a part of its marketing strategy. In order to do so, the Marketing Head wants to undertake an analysis which combines sales, brand awareness and brand perception of the company with most frequented locations/ venues in the city for ad placements in order to increase the impact of the marketing campaign."

    "\n",
    "a. Foursquare data will be used to get top 5 venues in each city (assumption: higher number of venues are linked with a highher demand for that category which would reflect on highher footfall/ visits) \n",
    "b. Foursquare data is augmented with the sales, brand awareness and sentiment about the product (product). \n",
    "c. Unsupervised clustering approach would be used to segment the locations and maximum impact strategy for each venue will be assesed for each location. This will eventually provide recommendations about the marketing strategy (in particular where to place the ad; depending on the type of venue- the content of the ad which can be tailor made to create maximum impact).\n",
